## Activity

- Create a class in `lib/practice.rb` with a method `stops_between_stations` to
  calculate the number of stops between stations on the "MBTA". Write additional
  classes and or methods as needed.
- The method takes the line and stop name that a rider is getting on at and the
  line and stop name that a rider is getting off at and **returns the total
  number of stops for the trip**.
- When `MBTA::Subway::System.new` is called, its initialize method should store
  all the information needed in `stops_between_stations`.

There are 3 subway lines:

- The Red line has the following stops: South Station, Park Street, Kendall,
  Central, Harvard, Porter, Davis, Alewife
- The Green line has the following stops: Government Center, Park Street,
  Boylston, Arlington, Copley, Hynes, Kenmore
- The Orange line has the following stops:  North Station, Haymarket, Park
  Street, State, Downtown Crossing, Chinatown, Back Bay, Forest Hills
- All 3 subway lines intersect at *Park Street*, but there are no other
  intersection points. Some of this MBTA is fictionalized.

## Checking your solution

Run `bin/rake test`.

## Hints

- Assume good input.  Your function need not check the validity of the line or
    stop name.
- Think about where to store initialization data.
- Consider diagramming the lines by sketching out the subway lines and their
    stops and intersection.
- The key to the practice is to find the **intersection** of the lines at
    *Park Street*.
- Solve an easier problem first.

## Bonus

Think about adding Haymarket before Government Center on the Green line then try
 to find a solution when there are multiple intersections.
Is there a way to decide if a particular solution is "correct"?

This bonus is completely optional and does not have tests, yet.

## Tasks

Developers should run these often!

- `bin/rake nag`  (or `bundle exec rake nag`):
    runs code quality analysis tools on your code and complains.
- `bin/rake test` (or `bundle exec rake test`): runs automated tests.
- `bin/rake` will run both `nag` and `test`
